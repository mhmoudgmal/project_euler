This is the lazy version of fibonacci sequence,
but it becomes very slow considering large number like the problem's one (4000000)


Enumerator.new do |yielder|
  a, b = 1, 1

  loop do
    yielder.yield a

    a, b = (a + b), a
  end
end


take(4000000) # It takes long time, so don't be too lazy, it's not always good
